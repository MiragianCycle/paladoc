= We are introducing Pala to the audience. This act will mostly be around childhood, with special emphasis paid to the profound influence of his father's art. 

## SCENE 1 
= Rapid cuts (but each cut is longer) juxtaposed with sound effects will open our documentary 

EXT. BLACK SCREEN
!CHANTING IN THE BACKGROUND AND THE FLICKERING OF A FIRE

Pala (VO)
‘I have always wanted to do what my father and grandfather wanted to do.’

CUT TO:

EXT. FIRE 

Closeup of a burning fire, wood crackling, the faint whisper of a chant building up.

CUT TO:

EXT. FACE

Closeup of the mouth that is reciting the incantation. The sound of a knife being sharpened. 

CUT TO:

<<<<<<< Updated upstream

EXT. FACE

Closeup of eye - the reflection of the fire can be seen, the incantation, the wave of sheer sonic mass is rising to a crescendo, and then ... 

ZOOM OUT (RAPIDLY) 

EXT. The Ceremonial Ground

EXT. Deniyaya

EXT. Zooming out of Sri Lanka, until we see the island from space. As we are zooming out, images of state-sponsored violence during the JVP Insurrection - archival footage, newspaper reports, radio news from that era - are juxtaposed with rapid cuts of Pala's works, focusing on his maps series especially; the music has now crescendoed. The 'camera', takes a second to breathe before..


ZOOM IN (RAPIDLY)

EXT. Deniyaya

EXT. The Ceremonial Ground

DOLLY (OUT)ZOOM (IN)

EXT. PALA (CENTERED) As we dolly out and zoom in at the same time, we can see Pala's face warp and consume the negative space around him, while the background seems to shrink.

CUT TO: 

(On screen-title): **PALA**

FADE TO: 


INT. An artist's studio. We don't see much of our Protaganist, as the camera is interested in his hands. And the sound of him at work - scratches on paper, led on textured paper. 

= in this first act, Pala will be addressing his daughter.

@PALA: (VO) 
'Duwa, I have always wanted to do what my father and grandfather did. You see...

@PALA: (VO)
We come from Deniyaya, in the deep south of Sri Lanka. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. SINHARAJA. 
We are looking at the Medarapitiya-Sinharaja bridge, spanning over the *Gin Ganga* from above. Against the sound of Peacocks in the distance, we can also hear the sound of food steps on brittle branches, as they crack. Someone is walking through this ancient forest... 

@PALA: 
This is ancient land with an ancient rainforest that has always seemed to want to swallow the town. I was born there in 1972, the year this country finally threw away its colonial name, and we named ourselves.

= Question for Pala - 
 = **1. Set out the timeframe before questioning to make clear that this is about his childhood in Deniyaya** 

= **2. Tell him that some of the questions may seem repetitive, but that it is intended to capture an ideal level of detail/emotional depth and texture through subtle variations**

= **3. Indicate in advance that if he's uncomfortable with any of the questions, he doesn't need to respond**
